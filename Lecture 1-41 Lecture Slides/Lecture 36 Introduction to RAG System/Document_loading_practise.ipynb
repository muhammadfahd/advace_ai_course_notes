They branded this technique “Deep Learning. ” Training a deep neural net\\nwas widely considered impossible at the time,2 and most researchers had abandoned\\nthe idea since the 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the scientific community\\nand before long many new papers demonstrated that Deep Learning was not only\\npossible, but capable of mind-blowing achievements that no other Machine Learning\\n(ML) technique could hope to match (with the help of tremendous computing power\\nand great amounts of data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of\\nMachine Learning.\\nFast-forward 10 years and Machine Learning has conquered the industry: it is now at\\nthe heart of much of the magic in today’s high-tech products, ranking your web\\nsearch results, powering your smartphone’s speech recognition, recommending vid‐\\neos, and beating the world champion at the game of Go. Before you know it, it will be\\ndriving your car.\\nMachine Learning in Your Projects\\nSo naturally you are excited about Machine Learning and you would love to join the\\nparty!\\nPerhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own?

Its goal\\nis to give you the concepts, the intuitions, and the tools you need to actually imple‐\\nment programs capable of learning from data .\\nWe will cover a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly\\nused (such as linear regression) to some of the Deep Learning techniques that regu‐\\nlarly win competitions.\\nRather than implementing our own toy versions of each algorithm, we will be using\\nactual production-ready Python frameworks:\\n•Scikit-Learn  is very easy to use, yet it implements many Machine Learning algo‐\\nrithms efficiently, so it makes for a great entry point to learn Machine Learning.\\n•TensorFlow  is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation. It\\nmakes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently by dis‐\\ntributing the computations across potentially hundreds of multi-GPU servers.\\nTensorFlow was created at Google and supports many of their large-scale\\nMachine Learning applications. It was open sourced in November 2015.\\n•Keras  is a high level Deep Learning API that makes it very simple to train and\\nrun neural networks. It can run on top of either TensorFlow, Theano or Micro‐\\nsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly known as CNTK). TensorFlow comes with its\\nown implementation of this API, called tf.keras , which provides support for some\\nadvanced TensorFlow features (e.g., to efficiently load data).\\nThe book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of\\nMachine Learning through concrete working examples and just a little bit of theory.\\nWhile you can read this book without picking up your laptop, we highly recommend\\nxii | Preface'),\n",

It will be a high-level overview (the only chapter\\nwithout much code), all rather simple, but you should make sure everything is\\ncrystal-clear to you before continuing to the rest of the book. So grab a coffee and let’s\\nget started!\\nIf you already know all the Machine Learning basics, you may want\\nto skip directly to Chapter 2 . If you are not sure, try to answer all\\nthe questions listed at the end of the chapter before moving on.\\nWhat Is Machine Learning?\\nMachine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can\\nlearn from data .\\nHere is a slightly more general definition:\\n[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn\\nwithout being explicitly programmed.\\n—Arthur Samuel, 1959\\nAnd a more engineering-oriented one:\\nA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T\\nand some performance measure P , if its performance on T, as measured by P , improves\\nwith experience E.\\n—Tom Mitchell, 1997\\nFor example, your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to flag\\nspam given examples of spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular\\n(nonspam, also called “ham”) emails. The examples that the system uses to learn are\\ncalled the training set . Each training example is called a training instance  (or sample ).\\nIn this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training\\ndata , and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use\\nthe ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called\\naccuracy  and it is often used in classification tasks.\\nIf you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is\\nnot suddenly better at any task. Thus, it is not Machine Learning.\\nWhy Use Machine Learning?\\nConsider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techni‐\\nques ( Figure 1-1 ):\\n4 | Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'different_docs/book.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='1.First you would look at what spam typically looks like. Y ou might notice that\\nsome words or phrases (such as “4U, ” “credit card, ” “free, ” and “amazing”) tend to\\ncome up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns\\nin the sender’s name, the email’s body, and so on.\\n2.Y ou would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed,\\nand your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns are\\ndetected.\\n3.Y ou would test your program, and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it is good enough.\\nFigure 1-1. The traditional approach\\nSince the problem is not trivial, your program will likely become a long list of com‐\\nplex rules—pretty hard to maintain.\\nIn contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically learns\\nwhich words and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually fre‐\\nquent patterns of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples\\n(Figure 1-2 ). The program is much shorter, easier to maintain, and most likely more\\naccurate.\\nWhy Use Machine Learning? | 5'),\n",

Machine Learning approach\\nMoreover, if spammers notice that all their emails containing “4U” are blocked, they\\nmight start writing “For U” instead. A spam filter using traditional programming\\ntechniques would need to be updated to flag “For U” emails. If spammers keep work‐\\ning around your spam filter, you will need to keep writing new rules forever.\\nIn contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically noti‐\\nces that “For U” has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users, and it starts\\nflagging them without your intervention ( Figure 1-3 ).\\nFigure 1-3. Automatically adapting to change\\nAnother area where Machine Learning shines is for problems that either are too com‐\\nplex for traditional approaches or have no known algorithm. For example, consider \\nspeech recognition: say you want to start simple and write a program capable of dis‐\\ntinguishing the words “one” and “two. ” Y ou might notice that the word “two” starts\\nwith a high-pitch sound (“T”), so you could hardcode an algorithm that measures\\nhigh-pitch sound intensity and use that to distinguish ones and twos. Obviously this\\ntechnique will not scale to thousands of words spoken by millions of very different\\n6 | Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape'),\n",

For instance, once the spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can\\neasily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it\\nbelieves are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected cor‐\\nrelations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.\\nApplying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns\\nthat were not immediately apparent.

The system would flag an email as spam if it has many words in com‐\\nmon with a known spam email.\\nThis is called instance-based learning : the system learns the examples by heart, then\\ngeneralizes to new cases by comparing them to the learned examples (or a subset of\\nthem), using a similarity measure.

Overfitting  the training data\\nComplex models such as deep neural networks can detect subtle patterns in the data,\\nbut if the training set is noisy, or if it is too small (which introduces sampling noise),\\nthen the model is likely to detect patterns in the noise itself. Obviously these patterns\\nwill not generalize to new instances. For example, say you feed your life satisfaction\\nmodel many more attributes, including uninformative ones such as the country’s\\nname. In that case, a complex model may detect patterns like the fact that all coun‐\\ntries in the training data with a w in their name have a life satisfaction greater than 7:\\nNew Zealand (7.3), Norway (7.4), Sweden (7.2), and Switzerland (7.5).

Y ou want to evaluate it, and fine-\\ntune it if necessary. Let’s see how.\\nTesting and Validating\\nThe only way to know how well a model will generalize to new cases is to actually try\\nit out on new cases. One way to do that is to put your model in production and moni‐\\ntor how well it performs. This works well, but if your model is horribly bad, your\\nusers will complain—not the best idea.\\nA better option is to split your data into two sets: the training set  and the test set . As\\nthese names imply, you train your model using the training set, and you test it using\\nthe test set. The error rate on new cases is called the generalization error  (or out-of-\\nsample error ), and by evaluating your model on the test set, you get an estimate of this\\nerror. This value tells you how well your model will perform on instances it has never\\nseen before.\\nIf the training error is low (i.e., your model makes few mistakes on the training set)\\nbut the generalization error is high, it means that your model is overfitting the train‐\\ning data.\\nIt is common to use 80% of the data for training and hold out  20%\\nfor testing. However, this depends on the size of the dataset: if it\\ncontains 10 million instances, then holding out 1% means your test\\nset will contain 100,000 instances: that’s probably more than\\nenough to get a good estimate of the generalization error.\\nTesting and Validating | 31'),\n",

The question is: how do you choose the value of\\nthe regularization hyperparameter? One option is to train 100 different models using\\n100 different values for this hyperparameter. Suppose you find the best hyperparame‐\\nter value that produces a model with the lowest generalization error, say just 5% error.\\nSo you launch this model into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as\\nwell as expected and produces 15% errors. What just happened?\\nThe problem is that you measured the generalization error multiple times on the test\\nset, and you adapted the model and hyperparameters to produce the best model for\\nthat particular set . This means that the model is unlikely to perform as well on new\\ndata.\\nA common solution to this problem is called holdout validation : you simply hold out\\npart of the training set to evaluate several candidate models and select the best one.\\nThe new heldout set is called the validation set  (or sometimes the development set , or\\ndev set ). More specifically, you train multiple models with various hyperparameters\\non the reduced training set (i.e., the full training set minus the validation set), and\\nyou select the model that performs best on the validation set. After this holdout vali‐\\ndation process, you train the best model on the full training set (including the valida‐\\ntion set), and this gives you the final model. Lastly, you evaluate this final model on\\nthe test set to get an estimate of the generalization error.\\nThis solution usually works quite well. However, if the validation set is too small, then\\nmodel evaluations will be imprecise: you may end up selecting a suboptimal model by\\nmistake. Conversely, if the validation set is too large, then the remaining training set\\nwill be much smaller than the full training set. Why is this bad? Well, since the final\\nmodel will be trained on the full training set, it is not ideal to compare candidate\\nmodels trained on a much smaller training set. It would be like selecting the fastest\\nsprinter to participate in a marathon. One way to solve this problem is to perform\\nrepeated cross-validation , using many small validation sets. Each model is evaluated\\nonce per validation set, after it is trained on the rest of the data. By averaging out all\\nthe evaluations of a model, we get a much more accurate measure of its performance.\\nHowever, there is a drawback: the training time is multiplied by the number of valida‐\\ntion sets.\\n32 | Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape'),\n",

The main design principles  are:17\\n•Consistency . All objects share a consistent and simple interface:\\n—Estimators . Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset\\nis called an estimator  (e.g., an imputer  is an estimator). The estimation itself is\\nperformed by the fit()  method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or\\ntwo for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the\\nlabels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is con‐\\nsidered a hyperparameter (such as an imputer ’s strategy ), and it must be set\\nas an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).\\n—Transformers . Some estimators (such as an imputer ) can also transform a\\ndataset; these are called transformers . Once again, the API is quite simple: the\\ntransformation is performed by the transform()  method with the dataset to\\ntransform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transforma‐\\ntion generally relies on the learned parameters, as is the case for an imputer .\\nAll transformers also have a convenience method called fit_transform()  \\nthat is equivalent to calling fit()  and then transform()  (but sometimes\\nfit_transform()  is optimized and runs much faster).\\n—Predictors . Finally, some estimators are capable of making predictions given a\\ndataset; they are called predictors . For example, the LinearRegression  model \\nin the previous chapter was a predictor: it predicted life satisfaction given a\\ncountry’s GDP per capita. A predictor has a predict()  method that takes a\\ndataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It\\nalso has a score()  method that measures the quality of the predictions given\\n68 | Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project'),\n",

If you use an earlier version, please consider upgrading, or use\\nPandas’ Series.factorize()  method.a test set (and the corresponding labels in the case of supervised learning\\nalgorithms).18\\n•Inspection . All the estimator’s hyperparameters are accessible directly via public\\ninstance variables (e.g., imputer.strategy ), and all the estimator’s learned\\nparameters are also accessible via public instance variables with an underscore\\nsuffix (e.g., imputer.statistics_ ).\\n•Nonproliferation of classes . Datasets are represented as NumPy arrays or SciPy\\nsparse matrices, instead of homemade classes. Hyperparameters are just regular\\nPython strings or numbers.\\n•Composition . Existing building blocks are reused as much as possible. For\\nexample, it is easy to create a Pipeline  estimator from an arbitrary sequence of\\ntransformers followed by a final estimator, as we will see.\\n•Sensible defaults . Scikit-Learn provides reasonable default values for most\\nparameters, making it easy to create a baseline working system quickly.\\nHandling Text and Categorical Attributes\\nEarlier we left out the categorical attribute ocean_proximity  because it is a text\\nattribute so we cannot compute its median:\\n>>> housing_cat  = housing[[\"ocean_proximity\" ]]\\n>>> housing_cat .head(10)\\n      ocean_proximity\\n17606       <1H OCEAN\\n18632       <1H OCEAN\\n14650      NEAR OCEAN\\n3230           INLAND\\n3555        <1H OCEAN\\n19480          INLAND\\n8879        <1H OCEAN\\n13685          INLAND\\n4937        <1H OCEAN\\n4861        <1H OCEAN\\nMost Machine Learning algorithms prefer to work with numbers anyway, so let’s con‐\\nvert these categories from text to numbers.

This may slow\\ndown training and degrade performance. If this happens, you may\\nwant to replace the categorical input with useful numerical features\\nrelated to the categories: for example, you could replace the\\nocean_proximity  feature with the distance to the ocean (similarly,\\na country code could be replaced with the country’s population and\\nGDP per capita).

The more you\\nautomate these data preparation steps, the more combinations you can automatically\\ntry out, making it much more likely that you will find a great combination (and sav‐\\ning you a lot of time).\\nFeature Scaling\\nOne of the most important transformations you need to apply to your data is feature\\nscaling . With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms don’t perform well when\\nthe input numerical attributes have very different scales. This is the case for the hous‐\\ning data: the total number of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median\\nincomes only range from 0 to 15. Note that scaling the target values is generally not\\nrequired.\\nThere are two common ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: min-max\\nscaling  and standardization .\\nMin-max scaling (many people call this normalization ) is quite simple: values are\\nshifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1. We do this by subtract‐\\ning the min value and dividing by the max minus the min. Scikit-Learn provides a\\n72 | Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project'),\n",

It has a feature_range  hyperparameter\\nthat lets you change the range if you don’t want 0–1 for some reason.\\nStandardization is quite different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized\\nvalues always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the standard deviation so that\\nthe resulting distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization\\ndoes not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algo‐\\nrithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). How‐\\never, standardization is much less affected by outliers. For example, suppose a district\\nhad a median income equal to 100 (by mistake). Min-max scaling would then crush\\nall the other values from 0–15 down to 0–0.15, whereas standardization would not be\\nmuch affected.

All but the last estimator must be transformers (i.e., they must have a\\nfit_transform()  method). The names can be anything you like (as long as they are\\nunique and don’t contain double underscores “ __”): they will come in handy later for\\nhyperparameter tuning.\\nWhen you call the pipeline’s fit()  method, it calls fit_transform()  sequentially on\\nall transformers, passing the output of each call as the parameter to the next call, until\\nit reaches the final estimator, for which it just calls the fit()  method.\\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms | 73'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'different_docs/book.pdf', 'page': 99}, page_content='22Just like for pipelines, the name can be anything as long as it does not contain double underscores.The pipeline exposes the same methods as the final estimator. In this example, the last\\nestimator is a StandardScaler , which is a transformer, so the pipeline has a trans\\nform()  method that applies all the transforms to the data in sequence (and of course\\nalso a fit_transform()  method, which is the one we used).\\nSo far, we have handled the categorical columns and the numerical columns sepa‐\\nrately. It would be more convenient to have a single transformer able to handle all col‐\\numns, applying the appropriate transformations to each column. In version 0.20,\\nScikit-Learn introduced the ColumnTransformer  for this purpose, and the good news\\nis that it works great with Pandas DataFrames. Let’s use it to apply all the transforma‐\\ntions to the housing data:\\nfrom sklearn.compose  import ColumnTransformer\\nnum_attribs  = list(housing_num )\\ncat_attribs  = [\"ocean_proximity\" ]\\nfull_pipeline  = ColumnTransformer ([\\n        (\"num\", num_pipeline , num_attribs ),\\n        (\"cat\", OneHotEncoder (), cat_attribs ),\\n    ])\\nhousing_prepared  = full_pipeline .fit_transform (housing)\\nHere is how this works: first we import the ColumnTransformer  class, next we get the\\nlist of numerical column names and the list of categorical column names, and we\\nconstruct a ColumnTransformer . The constructor requires a list of tuples, where each\\ntuple contains a name22, a transformer and a list of names (or indices) of columns\\nthat the transformer should be applied to. In this example, we specify that the numer‐\\nical columns should be transformed using the num_pipeline  that we defined earlier,\\nand the categorical columns should be transformed using a OneHotEncoder . Finally,\\nwe apply this ColumnTransformer  to the housing data: it applies each transformer to\\nthe appropriate columns and concatenates the outputs along the second axis (the\\ntransformers must return the same number of rows).\\nNote that the OneHotEncoder  returns a sparse matrix, while the num_pipeline  returns\\na dense matrix. When there is such a mix of sparse and dense matrices, the Colum\\nnTransformer  estimates the density of the final matrix (i.e., the ratio of non-zero\\ncells), and it returns a sparse matrix if the density is lower than a given threshold (by\\ndefault, sparse_threshold=0.3 ). In this example, it returns a dense matrix. And\\nthat’s it! We have a preprocessing pipeline that takes the full housing data and applies\\nthe appropriate transformations to each column.\\n74 | Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project'),\n",

In these cases, you can implement cross-\\nvalidation yourself; it is actually fairly straightforward. The following code does\\nroughly the same thing as Scikit-Learn’s cross_val_score()  function, and prints the \\nsame result:\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection  import StratifiedKFold\\nfrom sklearn.base  import clone\\nskfolds = StratifiedKFold (n_splits =3, random_state =42)\\nfor train_index , test_index  in skfolds.split(X_train, y_train_5 ):\\n    clone_clf  = clone(sgd_clf)\\n    X_train_folds  = X_train[train_index ]\\n    y_train_folds  = y_train_5 [train_index ]\\n    X_test_fold  = X_train[test_index ]\\n    y_test_fold  = y_train_5 [test_index ]\\n    clone_clf .fit(X_train_folds , y_train_folds )\\n    y_pred = clone_clf .predict(X_test_fold )\\n    n_correct  = sum(y_pred == y_test_fold )\\n    print(n_correct  / len(y_pred))  # prints 0.9502, 0.96565 and 0.96495\\nThe StratifiedKFold  class performs stratified sampling (as explained in Chapter 2 )\\nto produce folds that contain a representative ratio of each class. At each iteration the\\ncode creates a clone of the classifier, trains that clone on the training folds, and makes\\npredictions on the test fold. Then it counts the number of correct predictions and\\noutputs the ratio of correct predictions.\\nLet’s use the cross_val_score()  function to evaluate your SGDClassifier  model\\nusing K-fold cross-validation, with three folds. Remember that K-fold cross-\\nvalidation means splitting the training set into K-folds (in this case, three), then mak‐\\ning predictions and evaluating them on each fold using a model trained on the\\nremaining folds (see Chapter 2 ):\\nPerformance Measures | 91'),\n",

This is simply because only about 10% of the\\nimages are 5s, so if you always guess that an image is not a 5, you will be right about\\n90% of the time. Beats Nostradamus.\\nThis demonstrates why accuracy is generally not the preferred performance measure\\nfor classifiers, especially when you are dealing with skewed datasets  (i.e., when some\\nclasses are much more frequent than others).\\nConfusion Matrix\\nA much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the confu‐\\nsion matrix . The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are\\nclassified as class B.

This is not always\\nwhat you want: in some contexts you mostly care about precision, and in other con‐\\ntexts you really care about recall. For example, if you trained a classifier to detect vid‐\\neos that are safe for kids, you would probably prefer a classifier that rejects many\\ngood videos (low recall) but keeps only safe ones (high precision), rather than a clas‐\\nsifier that has a much higher recall but lets a few really bad videos show up in your\\nproduct (in such cases, you may even want to add a human pipeline to check the clas‐\\nsifier’s video selection). On the other hand, suppose you train a classifier to detect\\nshoplifters on surveillance images: it is probably fine if your classifier has only 30%\\nprecision as long as it has 99% recall (sure, the security guards will get a few false\\nalerts, but almost all shoplifters will get caught).\\nUnfortunately, you can’t have it both ways: increasing precision reduces recall, and\\nvice versa. This is called the precision/recall tradeoff .\\nPrecision/Recall Tradeoff\\nTo understand this tradeoff, let’s look at how the SGDClassifier  makes its classifica‐\\ntion decisions. For each instance, it computes a score based on a decision function , \\nand if that score is greater than a threshold, it assigns the instance to the positive\\nclass, or else it assigns it to the negative class. Figure 3-3  shows a few digits positioned\\nfrom the lowest score on the left to the highest score on the right. Suppose the deci‐\\nsion threshold  is positioned at the central arrow (between the two 5s): you will find 4\\ntrue positives (actual 5s) on the right of that threshold, and one false positive (actually\\na 6). Therefore, with that threshold, the precision is 80% (4 out of 5). But out of 6\\nactual 5s, the classifier only detects 4, so the recall is 67% (4 out of 6). Now if you\\nraise the threshold (move it to the arrow on the right), the false positive (the 6)\\nbecomes a true negative, thereby increasing precision (up to 100% in this case), but\\none true positive becomes a false negative, decreasing recall down to 50%. Conversely,\\nlowering the threshold increases recall and reduces precision.\\nPerformance Measures | 95'),\n",

Decision threshold and precision/recall tradeoff\\nScikit-Learn does not let you set the threshold directly, but it does give you access to\\nthe decision scores that it uses to make predictions. Instead of calling the classifier’s\\npredict()  method, you can call its decision_function()  method, which returns a\\nscore for each instance, and then make predictions based on those scores using any\\nthreshold you want:\\n>>> y_scores  = sgd_clf.decision_function ([some_digit ])\\n>>> y_scores\\narray([2412.53175101])\\n>>> threshold  = 0\\n>>> y_some_digit_pred  = (y_scores  > threshold )\\narray([ True])\\nThe SGDClassifier  uses a threshold equal to 0, so the previous code returns the same\\nresult as the predict()  method (i.e., True ).

The image actually repre‐\\nsents a 5, and the classifier detects it when the threshold is 0, but it misses it when the\\nthreshold is increased to 8,000.\\nNow how do you decide which threshold to use?

Now let’s try to detect more than just the 5s.\\nMulticlass Classification\\nWhereas binary classifiers distinguish between two classes, multiclass classifiers  (also\\ncalled multinomial classifiers ) can distinguish between more than two classes.\\nSome algorithms (such as Random Forest classifiers or naive Bayes classifiers) are\\ncapable of handling multiple classes directly. Others (such as Support Vector Machine\\nclassifiers or Linear classifiers) are strictly binary classifiers. However, there are vari‐\\nous strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification using multiple\\nbinary classifiers.\\nFor example, one way to create a system that can classify the digit images into 10\\nclasses (from 0 to 9) is to train 10 binary classifiers, one for each digit (a 0-detector, a\\n1-detector, a 2-detector, and so on). Then when you want to classify an image, you get\\nthe decision score from each classifier for that image and you select the class whose\\nclassifier outputs the highest score. This is called the one-versus-all  (OvA) strategy \\n(also called one-versus-the-rest ).\\nAnother strategy is to train a binary classifier for every pair of digits: one to distin‐\\nguish 0s and 1s, another to distinguish 0s and 2s, another for 1s and 2s, and so on.\\nThis is called the one-versus-one  (OvO) strategy. If there are N classes, you need to\\ntrain N × (N – 1) / 2 classifiers. For the MNIST problem, this means training 45\\nbinary classifiers! When you want to classify an image, you have to run the image\\nthrough all 45 classifiers and see which class wins the most duels. The main advan‐\\ntage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training\\nset for the two classes that it must distinguish.\\nSome algorithms (such as Support Vector Machine classifiers) scale poorly with the\\nsize of the training set, so for these algorithms OvO is preferred since it is faster to\\ntrain many classifiers on small training sets than training few classifiers on large\\ntraining sets. For most binary classification algorithms, however, OvA is preferred.\\n102 | Chapter 3: Classification'),\n",

The next lines create a KNeighborsClassifier  \\ninstance (which supports multilabel classification, but not all classifiers do) and we\\ntrain it using the multiple targets array. Now you can make a prediction, and notice\\nthat it outputs two labels:\\n>>> knn_clf.predict([some_digit ])\\narray([[False,  True]])\\nAnd it gets it right! The digit 5 is indeed not large ( False ) and odd ( True ).\\nThere are many ways to evaluate a multilabel classifier, and selecting the right metric\\nreally depends on your project.

It is simply a generaliza‐\\ntion of multilabel classification where each label can be multiclass (i.e., it can have\\nmore than two possible values).\\nTo illustrate this, let’s build a system that removes noise from images. It will take as\\ninput a noisy digit image, and it will (hopefully) output a clean digit image, repre‐\\nsented as an array of pixel intensities, just like the MNIST images. Notice that the\\nclassifier’s output is multilabel (one label per pixel) and each label can have multiple\\nvalues (pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255). It is thus an example of a multioutput\\nclassification system.\\nThe line between classification and regression is sometimes blurry,\\nsuch as in this example. Arguably, predicting pixel intensity is more\\nakin to regression than to classification. Moreover, multioutput\\nsystems are not limited to classification tasks; you could even have\\na system that outputs multiple labels per instance, including both\\nclass labels and value labels.\\nLet’s start by creating the training and test sets by taking the MNIST images and\\nadding noise to their pixel intensities using NumPy’s randint()  function.

Logistic Regression  (also called Logit Regression ) is com‐\\nmonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class\\n(e.g., what is the probability that this email is spam?). If the estimated probability is\\ngreater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class\\n(called the positive class, labeled “1”), or else it predicts that it does not (i.e., it\\nbelongs to the negative class, labeled “0”). This makes it a binary classifier.\\nEstimating Probabilities\\nSo how does it work? Just like a Linear Regression model, a Logistic Regression\\nmodel computes a weighted sum of the input features (plus a bias term), but instead\\nof outputting the result directly like the Linear Regression model does, it outputs the\\nlogistic  of this result (see Equation 4-13 ).\\nEquation 4-13. Logistic Regression model estimated probability (vectorized form)\\np=hθx=σxTθ\\nThe logistic—noted σ(·)—is a sigmoid function  (i.e., S-shaped) that outputs a number\\nbetween 0 and 1.

The downside is that a training set with m instances and n features\\ngets transformed into a training set with m instances and m features (assuming you\\ndrop the original features).

If it is,\\nthen you move down to the root’s left child node (depth 1, left). In this case, it is a leaf\\nnode  (i.e., it does not have any children nodes), so it does not ask any questions: you\\ncan simply look at the predicted class for that node and the Decision Tree predicts\\nthat your flower is an Iris-Setosa ( class=setosa ).\\nNow suppose you find another flower, but this time the petal length is greater than\\n2.45 cm. Y ou must move down to the root’s right child node (depth 1, right), which is\\nnot a leaf node, so it asks another question: is the petal width smaller than 1.75 cm? If\\nit is, then your flower is most likely an Iris-Versicolor (depth 2, left). If not, it is likely\\nan Iris-Virginica (depth 2, right).

A\\nnode’s value  attribute tells you how many training instances of each class this node\\napplies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris-\\nVersicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica. Finally, a node’s gini  attribute measures its impur‐\\nity: a node is “pure” ( gini=0 ) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same\\nclass. For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training\\ninstances, it is pure and its gini  score is 0.

Decision Tree decision boundaries\\nModel Interpretation: White Box Versus Black Box\\nAs you can see Decision Trees are fairly intuitive and their decisions are easy to inter‐\\npret. Such models are often called white box models . In contrast, as we will see, Ran‐\\ndom Forests or neural networks are generally considered black box models . They\\nmake great predictions, and you can easily check the calculations that they performed\\nto make these predictions; nevertheless, it is usually hard to explain in simple terms\\nwhy the predictions were made. For example, if a neural network says that a particu‐\\nlar person appears on a picture, it is hard to know what actually contributed to this\\nprediction: did the model recognize that person’s eyes? Her mouth? Her nose? Her\\nshoes? Or even the couch that she was sitting on? Conversely, Decision Trees provide\\nnice and simple classification rules that can even be applied manually if need be (e.g.,\\nfor flower classification).\\nEstimating Class Probabilities\\nA Decision Tree can also estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a partic‐\\nular class k: first it traverses the tree to find the leaf node for this instance, and then it\\nreturns the ratio of training instances of class k in this node. For example, suppose\\nyou have found a flower whose petals are 5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. The corre‐\\nsponding leaf node is the depth-2 left node, so the Decision Tree should output the\\nfollowing probabilities: 0% for Iris-Setosa (0/54), 90.7% for Iris-Versicolor (49/54),\\nand 9.3% for Iris-Virginica (5/54). And of course if you ask it to predict the class, it\\nshould output Iris-Versicolor (class 1) since it has the highest probability. Let’s check\\nthis:\\n>>> tree_clf .predict_proba ([[5, 1.5]])\\narray([[0.        , 0.90740741, 0.09259259]])\\nEstimating Class Probabilities | 181'),\n",

The idea is really quite simple: the algo‐\\nrithm first splits the training set in two subsets using a single feature k and a thres‐\\nhold tk (e.g., “petal length ≤  2.45 cm”). How does it choose k and tk? It searches for the\\npair ( k, tk) that produces the purest subsets (weighted by their size).

It stops recursing once it rea‐\\nches the maximum depth (defined by the max_depth  hyperparameter), or if it cannot\\nfind a split that will reduce impurity.

If P ≠ NP (which seems likely), then no polynomial algorithm will ever be\\nfound for any NP-Complete problem (except perhaps on a quantum computer).\\n3log2 is the binary logarithm. It is equal to log2(m) = log(m) / log(2).\\n4A reduction of entropy is often called an information gain .\\nAs you can see, the CART algorithm is a greedy algorithm : it greed‐\\nily searches for an optimum split at the top level, then repeats the\\nprocess at each level. It does not check whether or not the split will\\nlead to the lowest possible impurity several levels down. A greedy\\nalgorithm often produces a reasonably good solution, but it is not\\nguaranteed to be the optimal solution.\\nUnfortunately, finding the optimal tree is known to be an NP-\\nComplete  problem:2 it requires O(exp( m)) time, making the prob‐\\nlem intractable even for fairly small training sets. This is why we\\nmust settle for a “reasonably good” solution.\\nComputational Complexity\\nMaking predictions requires traversing the Decision Tree from the root to a leaf.\\nDecision Trees are generally approximately balanced, so traversing the Decision Tree\\nrequires going through roughly O(log2(m)) nodes.3 Since each node only requires\\nchecking the value of one feature, the overall prediction complexity is just O(log2(m)),\\nindependent of the number of features.

However, when they differ, Gini impurity tends to\\nisolate the most frequent class in its own branch of the tree, while entropy tends to\\nproduce slightly more balanced trees.5\\nRegularization Hyperparameters\\nDecision Trees make very few assumptions about the training data (as opposed to lin‐\\near models, which obviously assume that the data is linear, for example). If left\\nunconstrained, the tree structure will adapt itself to the training data, fitting it very\\nclosely, and most likely overfitting it. Such a model is often called a nonparametric\\nmodel , not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the\\nnumber of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is\\nfree to stick closely to the data. In contrast, a parametric model  such as a linear model\\nhas a predetermined number of parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited,\\nreducing the risk of overfitting (but increasing the risk of underfitting).\\nTo avoid overfitting the training data, you need to restrict the Decision Tree’s freedom\\nduring training. As you know by now, this is called regularization. The regularization\\nhyperparameters depend on the algorithm used, but generally you can at least restrict\\nthe maximum depth of the Decision Tree. In Scikit-Learn, this is controlled by the\\nmax_depth  hyperparameter (the default value is None , which means unlimited).\\nReducing max_depth  will regularize the model and thus reduce the risk of overfitting.\\nThe DecisionTreeClassifier  class has a few other parameters that similarly restrict\\nthe shape of the Decision Tree: min_samples_split  (the minimum number of sam‐\\nples a node must have before it can be split), min_samples_leaf  (the minimum num‐\\nber of samples a leaf node must have), min_weight_fraction_leaf  (same as\\nmin_samples_leaf  but expressed as a fraction of the total number of weighted\\n184 | Chapter 6: Decision Trees'),\n",

Stan‐\\ndard statistical tests, such as the χ2 test, are used to estimate the\\nprobability that the improvement is purely the result of chance\\n(which is called the null hypothesis ).

So while most of the variance is preserved, the dataset is\\nnow less than 20% of its original size! This is a reasonable compression ratio, and you\\ncan see how this can speed up a classification algorithm (such as an SVM classifier)\\ntremendously.\\nIt is also possible to decompress the reduced dataset back to 784 dimensions by\\napplying the inverse transformation of the PCA projection. Of course this won’t give\\nyou back the original data, since the projection lost a bit of information (within the\\n5% variance that was dropped), but it will likely be quite close to the original data.\\nThe mean squared distance between the original data and the reconstructed data\\n(compressed and then decompressed) is called the reconstruction error . For example,\\nthe following code compresses the MNIST dataset down to 154 dimensions, then uses\\nthe inverse_transform()  method to decompress it back to 784 dimensions.\\nFigure 8-9  shows a few digits from the original training set (on the left), and the cor‐\\nresponding digits after compression and decompression.

This is controlled by the n_init  hyperparameter:\\nby default, it is equal to 10, which means that the whole algorithm described earlier\\nactually runs 10 times when you call fit() , and Scikit-Learn keeps the best solution.\\nBut how exactly does it know which solution is the best? Well of course it uses a per‐\\nformance metric! It is called the model’s inertia : this is the mean squared distance\\nbetween each instance and its closest centroid. It is roughly equal to 223.3 for the\\nmodel on the left of Figure 9-5 , 237.5 for the model on the right of Figure 9-5 , and\\n211.6 for the model in Figure 9-3 .

Unlike K-\\nMeans, EM uses soft cluster assignments rather than hard assignments: for each\\ninstance during the expectation step, the algorithm estimates the probability that it\\nbelongs to each cluster (based on the current cluster parameters).

It assumes that the normal instances (inliers) are generated\\nfrom a single Gaussian distribution (not a mixture), but it also assumes that the\\ndataset is contaminated with outliers that were not generated from this Gaussian\\ndistribution. When it estimates the parameters of the Gaussian distribution (i.e.,\\nthe shape of the elliptic envelope around the inliers), it is careful to ignore the\\ninstances that are most likely outliers. This gives a better estimation of the elliptic\\nenvelope, and thus makes it better at identifying the outliers.\\n•Isolation forest : this is an efficient algorithm for outlier detection, especially in\\nhigh-dimensional datasets. The algorithm builds a Random Forest in which each\\nDecision Tree is grown randomly: at each node, it picks a feature randomly, then\\nit picks a random threshold value (between the min and max value) to split the\\ndataset in two. The dataset gradually gets chopped into pieces this way, until all\\ninstances end up isolated from the other instances. An anomaly is usually far\\nfrom other instances, so on average (across all the Decision Trees) it tends to get\\nisolated in less steps than normal instances.\\n•Local outlier factor  (LOF): this algorithm is also good for outlier detection. It\\ncompares the density of instances around a given instance to the density around\\nits neighbors. An anomaly is often more isolated than its k nearest neighbors.\\n•One-class SVM : this algorithm is better suited for novelty detection. Recall that a\\nkernelized SVM classifier separates two classes by first (implicitly) mapping all\\nthe instances to a high-dimensional space, then separating the two classes using a\\nlinear SVM classifier within this high-dimensional space (see Chapter 5 ). Since\\nwe just have one class of instances, the one-class SVM algorithm instead tries to\\nseparate the instances in high-dimensional space from the origin. In the original\\nspace, this will correspond to finding a small region that encompasses all the\\ninstances. If a new instance does not fall within this region, it is an anomaly.\\nThere are a few hyperparameters to tweak: the usual ones for a kernelized SVM,\\nplus a margin hyperparameter that corresponds to the probability of a new\\ninstance being mistakenly considered as novel, when it is in fact normal.

For every\\noutput neuron that produced a wrong prediction, it reinforces the connection\\nweights from the inputs that would have contributed to the correct prediction. The\\nrule is shown in Equation 10-3 .\\nEquation 10-3.

However, if the\\ntraining instances are linearly separable, Rosenblatt demonstrated that this algorithm\\nwould converge to a solution.7 This is called the Perceptron convergence theorem .\\nScikit-Learn provides a Perceptron  class that implements a single TLU network.

The resulting ANN is called a Multi-Layer Perceptron\\n(MLP). In particular, an MLP can solve the XOR problem, as you can verify by com‐\\nputing the output of the MLP represented on the right of Figure 10-6 : with inputs (0,\\n0) or (1, 1) the network outputs 0, and with inputs (0, 1) or (1, 0) it outputs 1.

It has actually been shown that an MLP with just one hidden layer\\ncan model even the most complex functions provided it has enough neurons. For a\\nlong time, these facts convinced researchers that there was no need to investigate any\\ndeeper neural networks. But they overlooked the fact that deep networks have a much\\nhigher parameter efficiency  than shallow ones: they can model complex functions\\nusing exponentially fewer neurons than shallow nets, allowing them to reach much\\nbetter performance with the same amount of training data.\\nTo understand why, suppose you are asked to draw a forest using some drawing soft‐\\nware, but you are forbidden to use copy/paste. Y ou would have to draw each tree\\nindividually, branch per branch, leaf per leaf. If you could instead draw one leaf,\\ncopy/paste it to draw a branch, then copy/paste that branch to create a tree, and\\nfinally copy/paste this tree to make a forest, you would be finished in no time. Real-\\nworld data is often structured in such a hierarchical way and Deep Neural Networks\\nautomatically take advantage of this fact: lower hidden layers model low-level struc‐\\ntures (e.g., line segments of various shapes and orientations), intermediate hidden\\nlayers combine these low-level structures to model intermediate-level structures (e.g.,\\nsquares, circles), and the highest hidden layers and the output layer combine these\\nintermediate structures to model high-level structures (e.g., faces).\\nNot only does this hierarchical architecture help DNNs converge faster to a good sol‐\\nution, it also improves their ability to generalize to new datasets. For example, if you\\nhave already trained a model to recognize faces in pictures, and you now want to\\ntrain a new neural network to recognize hairstyles, then you can kickstart training by\\nreusing the lower layers of the first network. Instead of randomly initializing the\\nweights and biases of the first few layers of the new neural network, you can initialize\\nthem to the value of the weights and biases of the lower layers of the first network.\\nThis way the network will not have to learn from scratch all the low-level structures\\nthat occur in most pictures; it will only have to learn the higher-level structures (e.g.,\\nhairstyles). This is called transfer learning .\\nIn summary, for many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and\\nit will work just fine (e.g., you can easily reach above 97% accuracy on the MNIST\\ndataset using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons, and above 98% accu‐\\nracy using two hidden layers with the same total amount of neurons, in roughly the\\nsame amount of training time).

For example, the MNIST task requires 28\\nx 28 = 784 input neurons and 10 output neurons.\\nAs for the hidden layers, it used to be a common practice to size them to form a pyra‐\\nmid, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer—the rationale being that many low-\\nlevel features can coalesce into far fewer high-level features. For example, a typical\\nneural network for MNIST may have three hidden layers, the first with 300 neurons,\\nthe second with 200, and the third with 100. However, this practice has been largely\\nabandoned now, as it seems that simply using the same number of neurons in all hid‐\\nden layers performs just as well in most cases, or even better, and there is just one\\nhyperparameter to tune instead of one per layer—for example, all hidden layers could\\nsimply have 150 neurons. However, depending on the dataset, it can sometimes help\\nto make the first hidden layer bigger than the others.\\nJust like for the number of layers, you can try increasing the number of neurons grad‐\\nually until the network starts overfitting. In general you will get more bang for the\\nbuck by increasing the number of layers than the number of neurons per layer.\\nUnfortunately, as you can see, finding the perfect amount of neurons is still somewhat\\nof a dark art.\\nA simpler approach is to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you\\nactually need, then use early stopping to prevent it from overfitting (and other regu‐\\nlarization techniques, such as dropout , as we will see in Chapter 11 ).

That said, it is sometimes\\nuseful to reduce the learning rate during training: we will discuss this in Chap‐\\nter 11 .\\n•Choosing a better optimizer than plain old Mini-batch Gradient Descent (and\\ntuning its hyperparameters) is also quite important. We will discuss this in Chap‐\\nter 11 .\\n•The batch size can also have a significant impact on your model’s performance\\nand the training time. In general the optimal batch size will be lower than 32 (in\\nApril 2018, Y ann Lecun even tweeted \" Friends don’t let friends use mini-batches\\nlarger than 32 “). A small batch size ensures that each training iteration is very\\nfast, and although a large batch size will give a more precise estimate of the gradi‐\\nents, in practice this does not matter much since the optimization landscape is\\nquite complex and the direction of the true gradients do not point precisely in\\nthe direction of the optimum. However, having a batch size greater than 10 helps\\ntake advantage of hardware and software optimizations, in particular for matrix\\nmultiplications, so it will speed up training. Moreover, if you use Batch Normal‐\\nization  (see Chapter 11 ), the batch size should not be too small (in general no less\\nthan 20).\\n•We discussed the choice of the activation function earlier in this chapter: in gen‐\\neral, the ReLU activation function will be a good default for all hidden layers. For\\nthe output layer, it really depends on your task.\\n•In most cases, the number of training iterations does not actually need to be\\ntweaked: just use early stopping instead.\\nFor more best practices, make sure to read Y oshua Bengio’s great 2012 paper18, which\\npresents many practical recommendations for deep networks.\\nThis concludes this introduction to artificial neural networks and their implementa‐\\ntion with Keras.

Once\\nthe algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost function with regards to each\\nparameter in the network, it uses these gradients to update each parameter with a\\nGradient Descent step.\\nUnfortunately, gradients often get smaller and smaller as the algorithm progresses\\ndown to the lower layers. As a result, the Gradient Descent update leaves the lower\\nlayer connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good\\nsolution. This is called the vanishing gradients  problem. In some cases, the opposite\\ncan happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger, so many layers get insanely\\nlarge weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the exploding gradients  prob‐\\nlem, which is mostly encountered in recurrent neural networks (see ???). More gener‐\\nally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at\\nwidely different speeds.\\nAlthough this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for quite a while\\n(it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were mostly abandoned for a\\nlong time), it is only around 2010 that significant progress was made in understand‐\\ning it. A paper titled “Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep Feedforward\\nNeural Networks”  by Xavier Glorot and Y oshua Bengio1 found a few suspects, includ‐\\ning the combination of the popular logistic sigmoid activation function and the\\nweight initialization technique that was most popular at the time, namely random ini‐\\ntialization using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\\nIn short, they showed that with this activation function and this initialization scheme,\\nthe variance of the outputs of each layer is much greater than the variance of its\\ninputs. Going forward in the network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer\\nuntil the activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made worse by\\nthe fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0 (the hyperbolic tangent\\nfunction has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly better than the logistic function in deep\\nnetworks).\\n326 | Chapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks'),\n",

Until then most people had assumed that if Mother Nature had chosen to use\\nroughly sigmoid activation functions in biological neurons, they must be an excellent\\nchoice. But it turns out that other activation functions behave much better in deep\\nneural networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because it does\\nnot saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite fast to compute).\\nUnfortunately, the ReLU activation function is not perfect. It suffers from a problem\\nknown as the dying ReLUs : during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning\\nthey stop outputting anything other than 0. In some cases, you may find that half of\\nyour network’s neurons are dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. A neu‐\\nron dies when its weights get tweaked in such a way that the weighted sum of its\\ninputs are negative for all instances in the training set. When this happens, it just\\nkeeps outputting 0s, and gradient descent does not affect it anymore since the gradi‐\\nent of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is negative.4\\nTo solve this problem, you may want to use a variant of the ReLU function, such as\\nthe leaky ReLU . This function is defined as LeakyReLUα(z) = max( αz, z) (see\\nFigure 11-2 ). The hyperparameter α defines how much the function “leaks”: it is the\\nslope of the function for z < 0, and is typically set to 0.01. This small slope ensures\\nthat leaky ReLUs never die; they can go into a long coma, but they have a chance to\\neventually wake up.

They also evaluated the\\nrandomized leaky ReLU  (RReLU), where α is picked randomly in a given range during\\ntraining, and it is fixed to an average value during testing.

In other words, this operation lets the model\\nlearn the optimal scale and mean of each of the layer’s inputs. In many cases, if you\\nadd a BN layer as the very first layer of your neural network, you do not need to\\nstandardize your training set (e.g., using a StandardScaler ): the BN layer will do it\\nfor you (well, approximately, since it only looks at one batch at a time, and it can also\\nrescale and shift each input feature).\\nIn order to zero-center and normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate\\neach input’s mean and standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and stan‐\\ndard deviation of each input over the current mini-batch (hence the name “Batch\\nNormalization”). The whole operation is summarized in Equation 11-3 .\\nEquation 11-3.

What about at test time? Well it is not that simple. Indeed, we may need to\\nmake predictions for individual instances rather than for batches of instances: in this\\ncase, we will have no way to compute each input’s mean and standard deviation.\\nMoreover, even if we do have a batch of instances, it may be too small, or the instan‐\\nces may not be independent and identically distributed (IID), so computing statistics\\nover the batch instances would be unreliable (during training, the batches should not\\nbe too small, if possible more than 30 instances, and all instances should be IID, as we\\nsaw in Chapter 4 ). One solution could be to wait until the end of training, then run\\nthe whole training set through the neural network, and compute the mean and stan‐\\ndard deviation of each input of the BN layer. These “final” input means and standard\\ndeviations can then be used instead of the batch input means and standard deviations\\nwhen making predictions. However, it is often preferred to estimate these final statis‐\\ntics during training using a moving average of the layer’s input means and standard\\ndeviations. To sum up, four parameter vectors are learned in each batch-normalized\\nlayer: γ (the ouput scale vector) and β (the output offset vector) are learned through\\nregular backpropagation, and μ (the final input mean vector), and σ (the final input\\nstandard deviation vector) are estimated using an exponential moving average.

For example:\\noptimizer  = keras.optimizers .SGD(clipvalue =1.0)\\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mse\", optimizer =optimizer )\\nThis will clip every component of the gradient vector to a value between –1.0 and 1.0.\\nThis means that all the partial derivatives of the loss (with regards to each and every\\ntrainable parameter) will be clipped between –1.0 and 1.0. The threshold is a hyper‐\\nparameter you can tune. Note that it may change the orientation of the gradient vec‐\\ntor: for example, if the original gradient vector is [0.9, 100.0], it points mostly in the\\ndirection of the second axis, but once you clip it by value, you get [0.9, 1.0], which\\npoints roughly in the diagonal between the two axes. In practice however, this\\napproach works well. If you want to ensure that Gradient Clipping does not change\\nthe direction of the gradient vector, you should clip by norm by setting clipnorm\\ninstead of clipvalue . This will clip the whole gradient if its ℓ2 norm is greater than\\nthe threshold you picked. For example, if you set clipnorm=1.0 , then the vector [0.9,\\n100.0] will be clipped to [0.00899964, 0.9999595], preserving its orientation, but\\nalmost eliminating the first component.

While drinking your morn‐\\ning coffee, you realize that your task is quite similar to task A, so perhaps transfer\\nlearning can help?

Let’s reuse all layers except for the output layer:\\nmodel_A = keras.models.load_model (\"my_model_A.h5\" )\\nmodel_B_on_A  = keras.models.Sequential (model_A.layers[:-1])\\nmodel_B_on_A .add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation =\"sigmoid\" ))\\nNote that model_A  and model_B_on_A  now share some layers. When you train\\nmodel_B_on_A , it will also affect model_A . If you want to avoid that, you need to clone\\nmodel_A  before you reuse its layers.

In other words, the gradient is used for accel‐\\neration, not for speed. To simulate some sort of friction mechanism and prevent the\\nmomentum from growing too large, the algorithm introduces a new hyperparameter\\nβ, simply called the momentum , which must be set between 0 (high friction) and 1\\n(no friction).

If we don’t, each neuron will\\nget a total input signal roughly twice as large as what the network was trained on, and\\nit is unlikely to perform well. More generally, we need to multiply each input connec‐\\ntion weight by the keep probability  (1 – p) after training. Alternatively, we can divide\\neach neuron’s output by the keep probability during training (these alternatives are\\nnot perfectly equivalent, but they work equally well).\\nTo implement dropout using Keras, you can use the keras.layers.Dropout  layer.\\nDuring training, it randomly drops some inputs (setting them to 0) and divides the\\nremaining inputs by the keep probability. After training, it does nothing at all, it just\\npasses the inputs to the next layer. For example, the following code applies dropout\\nregularization before every Dense  layer, using a dropout rate of 0.2:\\nmodel = keras.models.Sequential ([\\n    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape =[28, 28]),\\n    keras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.2),\\n    keras.layers.Dense(300, activation =\"elu\", kernel_initializer =\"he_normal\" ),\\n    keras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.2),\\n    keras.layers.Dense(100, activation =\"elu\", kernel_initializer =\"he_normal\" ),\\n    keras.layers.Dropout(rate=0.2),\\n    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation =\"softmax\" )\\n])\\nSince dropout is only active during training, the training loss is\\npenalized compared to the validation loss, so comparing the two\\ncan be misleading. In particular, a model may be overfitting the\\ntraining set and yet have similar training and validation losses. So\\nmake sure to evaluate the training loss without dropout (e.g., after\\ntraining). Alternatively, you can call the fit()  method inside a\\nwith keras.backend.learning_phase_scope(1)  block: this will\\nforce dropout to be active during both training and validation.25\\nIf you observe that the model is overfitting, you can increase the dropout rate. Con‐\\nversely, you should try decreasing the dropout rate if the model underfits the training\\nset. It can also help to increase the dropout rate for large layers, and reduce it for\\nsmall ones. Moreover, many state-of-the-art architectures only use dropout after the\\nlast hidden layer, so you may want to try this if full dropout is too strong.\\nDropout does tend to significantly slow down convergence, but it usually results in a\\nmuch better model when tuned properly. So, it is generally well worth the extra time\\nand effort.\\nAvoiding Overfitting  Through Regularization | 359'),\n",

Other operators\\n(like -, *, etc.) are also supported. The @ operator was added in Python 3.5, for matrix\\nmultiplication: it is equivalent to calling the tf.matmul()  function.\\nY ou will find all the basic math operations you need (e.g., tf.add() , tf.multiply() ,\\ntf.square() , tf.exp() , tf.sqrt() …), and more generally most operations that you\\ncan find in NumPy (e.g., tf.reshape() , tf.squeeze() , tf.tile() ), but sometimes\\nwith a different name (e.g., tf.reduce_mean() , tf.reduce_sum() , tf.reduce_max() ,\\ntf.math.log()  are the equivalent of np.mean() , np.sum() , np.max()  and np.log() ).\\nWhen the name differs, there is often a good reason for it: for example, in Tensor‐\\nFlow you must write tf.transpose(t) , you cannot just write t.T like in NumPy. The\\nreason is that it does not do exactly the same thing: in TensorFlow, a new tensor is\\ncreated with its own copy of the transposed data, while in NumPy, t.T is just a trans‐\\nposed view on the same data. Similarly, the tf.reduce_sum()  operation is named this\\nway because its GPU kernel (i.e., GPU implementation) uses a reduce algorithm that\\ndoes not guarantee the order in which the elements are added: because 32-bit floats\\nhave limited precision, this means that the result may change ever so slightly every\\ntime you call this operation. The same is true of tf.reduce_mean()  (but of course\\ntf.reduce_max()  is deterministic).\\n372 | Chapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow'),\n",

This allows TensorFlow\\nto have concise names for the most common operations4, while\\npreserving well organized packages.\\nKeras’ Low-Level API\\nThe Keras API actually has its own low-level API, located in keras.backend . It\\nincludes functions like square() , exp() , sqrt()  and so on. In tf.keras, these func‐\\ntions generally just call the corresponding TensorFlow operations. If you want to\\nwrite code that will be portable to other Keras implementations, you should use these\\nKeras functions.

So when you create a tensor from a NumPy array, make sure\\nto set dtype=tf.float32 .\\nType Conversions\\nType conversions can significantly hurt performance, and they can easily go unno‐\\nticed when they are done automatically. To avoid this, TensorFlow does not perform\\nany type conversions automatically: it just raises an exception if you try to execute an\\noperation on tensors with incompatible types. For example, you cannot add a float\\ntensor and an integer tensor, and you cannot even add a 32-bit float and a 64-bit float:\\n>>> tf.constant (2.) + tf.constant (40)\\nTraceback[...]InvalidArgumentError[...]expected to be a float[...]\\n>>> tf.constant (2.) + tf.constant (40., dtype=tf.float64)\\nTraceback[...]InvalidArgumentError[...]expected to be a double[...]\\nThis may be a bit annoying at first, but remember that it’s for a good cause!

However, the weights in a neural network need to be tweaked by backpropaga‐\\ntion, and other parameters may also need to change over time (e.g., a momentum\\noptimizer keeps track of past gradients). What we need is a tf.Variable :\\n>>> v = tf.Variable ([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]])\\n>>> v\\n<tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=(2, 3) dtype=float32, numpy=\\narray([[1., 2., 3.],\\n       [4., 5., 6.]], dtype=float32)>\\nA tf.Variable  acts much like a constant tensor: you can perform the same opera‐\\ntions with it, it plays nicely with NumPy as well, and it is just as picky with types.

Moreover, model parameters will generally be\\nupdated directly by the optimizers, so you will rarely need to\\nupdate variables manually.\\nOther Data Structures\\nTensorFlow supports several other data structures, including the following (please see\\nthe notebook or ??? for more details):\\n•Sparse tensors  (tf.SparseTensor ) efficiently represent tensors containing mostly\\n0s. The tf.sparse  package contains operations for sparse tensors.\\n•Tensor arrays  (tf.TensorArray ) are lists of tensors. They have a fixed size by\\ndefault, but can optionally be made dynamic. All tensors they contain must have\\nthe same shape and data type.\\n•Ragged tensors  (tf.RaggedTensor ) represent static lists of lists of tensors, where\\nevery tensor has the same shape and data type. The tf.ragged  package contains\\noperations for ragged tensors.\\n•String tensors  are regular tensors of type tf.string . These actually represent byte\\nstrings, not Unicode strings, so if you create a string tensor using a Unicode\\nstring (e.g., a regular Python 3 string like \"café\"` ), then it will get encoded to\\nUTF-8 automatically (e.g., b\"caf\\\\xc3\\\\xa9\" ). Alternatively, you can represent\\nUnicode strings using tensors of type tf.int32 , where each item represents a\\nUnicode codepoint (e.g., [99, 97, 102, 233] ). The tf.strings  package (with\\nan s) contains ops for byte strings and Unicode strings (and to convert one into\\nthe other).\\n•Sets are just represented as regular tensors (or sparse tensors) containing one or\\nmore sets, and you can manipulate them using operations from the tf.sets\\npackage.\\n•Queues , including First In, First Out (FIFO) queues ( FIFOQueue ), queues that can\\nprioritize some items ( PriorityQueue ), queues that shuffle their items ( Random\\nShuffleQueue ), and queues that can batch items of different shapes by padding\\n(PaddingFIFOQueue ). These classes are all in the tf.queue  package.\\nWith tensors, operations, variables and various data structures at your disposal, you\\nare now ready to customize your models and training algorithms!\\nUsing TensorFlow like NumPy | 375'),\n",

In this case, you will\\nneed to create a custom layer. Or sometimes you may simply want to build a very\\nrepetitive architecture, containing identical blocks of layers repeated many times, and\\nit would be convenient to treat each block of layers as a single layer. For example, if\\nthe model is a sequence of layers A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C, then you might want to\\ndefine a custom layer D containing layers A, B, C, and your model would then simply\\nbe D, D, D. Let’s see how to build custom layers.\\nFirst, some layers have no weights, such as keras.layers.Flatten  or keras.lay\\ners.ReLU . If you want to create a custom layer without any weights, the simplest\\noption is to write a function and wrap it in a keras.layers.Lambda  layer. For exam‐\\nple, the following layer will apply the exponential function to its inputs:\\nexponential_layer  = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.exp(x))\\nThis custom layer can then be used like any other layer, using the sequential API, the\\nfunctional API, or the subclassing API. Y ou can also use it as an activation function\\n(or you could just use activation=tf.exp , or activation=keras.activations.expo\\nnential , or simply activation=\"exponential\" ). The exponential layer is sometimes\\nused in the output layer of a regression model when the values to predict have very\\ndifferent scales (e.g., 0.001, 10., 1000.).\\nAs you probably guessed by now, to build a custom stateful layer (i.e., a layer with\\nweights), you need to create a subclass of the keras.layers.Layer  class. For exam‐\\nple, the following class implements a simplified version of the Dense  layer:\\nclass MyDense(keras.layers.Layer):\\n    def __init__ (self, units, activation =None, **kwargs):\\n        super().__init__ (**kwargs)\\n        self.units = units\\n        self.activation  = keras.activations .get(activation )\\n    def build(self, batch_input_shape ):\\n        self.kernel = self.add_weight (\\n            name=\"kernel\" , shape=[batch_input_shape [-1], self.units],\\n            initializer =\"glorot_normal\" )\\n        self.bias = self.add_weight (\\n            name=\"bias\", shape=[self.units], initializer =\"zeros\")\\n        super().build(batch_input_shape ) # must be at the end\\n    def call(self, X):\\n        return self.activation (X @ self.kernel + self.bias)\\n    def compute_output_shape (self, batch_input_shape ):\\n        return tf.TensorShape (batch_input_shape .as_list()[:-1] + [self.units])\\nCustomizing Models and Training Algorithms | 383'),\n",

The build()  method is called the first\\ntime the layer is used. At that point, Keras will know the shape of this layer’s\\ninputs, and it will pass it to the build()  method9, which is often necessary to cre‐\\nate some of the weights. For example, we need to know the number of neurons in\\nthe previous layer in order to create the connection weights matrix (i.e., the \"ker\\nnel\" ): this corresponds to the size of the last dimension of the inputs. At the end\\nof the build()  method (and only at the end), you must call the parent’s build()\\nmethod: this tells Keras that the layer is built (it just sets self.built = True ).\\n•The call()  method actually performs the desired operations. In this case, we\\ncompute the matrix multiplication of the inputs X and the layer’s kernel, we add\\nthe bias vector, we apply the activation function to the result, and this gives us the\\noutput of the layer.\\n•The compute_output_shape()  method simply returns the shape of this layer’s\\noutputs.

Y es, there are still a couple things that we\\nneed to look at: first, how to define losses or metrics based on model internals, and\\nsecond how to build a custom training loop.\\nLosses and Metrics Based on Model Internals\\nThe custom losses and metrics we defined earlier were all based on the labels and the\\npredictions (and optionally sample weights). However, you will occasionally want to\\ndefine losses based on other parts of your model, such as the weights or activations of\\nits hidden layers. This may be useful for regularization purposes, or to monitor some\\ninternal aspect of your model.\\nTo define a custom loss based on model internals, just compute it based on any part\\nof the model you want, then pass the result to the add_loss()  method. For example,\\nthe following custom model represents a standard MLP regressor with 5 hidden lay‐\\ners, except it also implements a reconstruction loss  (see ???): we add an extra Dense\\nlayer on top of the last hidden layer, and its role is to try to reconstruct the inputs of\\nthe model. Since the reconstruction must have the same shape as the model’s inputs,\\nwe need to create this Dense  layer in the build()  method to have access to the shape\\nof the inputs. In the call()  method, we compute both the regular output of the MLP ,\\nplus the output of the reconstruction layer. We then compute the mean squared dif‐\\nference between the reconstructions and the inputs, and we add this value (times\\n0.05) to the model’s list of losses by calling add_loss() . During training, Keras will\\nadd this loss to the main loss (which is why we scaled down the reconstruction loss,\\nto ensure the main loss dominates). As a result, the model will be forced to preserve\\nas much information as possible through the hidden layers, even information that is\\nnot directly useful for the regression task itself. In practice, this loss sometimes\\nimproves generalization; it is a regularization loss:\\nclass ReconstructingRegressor (keras.models.Model):\\n    def __init__ (self, output_dim , **kwargs):\\n        super().__init__ (**kwargs)\\n        self.hidden = [keras.layers.Dense(30, activation =\"selu\",\\n                                          kernel_initializer =\"lecun_normal\" )\\n388 | Chapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow'),\n",

The Jacobians are obviously the same as earlier (36 and 5), but\\nnow we also have the Hessians:\\n>>> hessians  # dz_dw1_dw1, dz_dw1_dw2, dz_dw2_dw1, dz_dw2_dw2\\n[[<tf.Tensor: id=830578, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>,\\n  <tf.Tensor: id=830595, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>],\\n [<tf.Tensor: id=830600, shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>, None]]\\nLet’s verify these Hessians. The first two are the partial derivatives of 6 * w1  + 2 * w2\\n(which is, as we saw earlier, the partial derivative of f with regards to w1), with\\nregards to w1 and w2. The result is correct: 6 for w1 and 2 for w2.

Note that TensorFlow returns\\nNone  instead of 0 since w2 does not appear at all in 2 * w1 . TensorFlow also returns\\nNone  when you use an operation whose gradients are not defined (e.g., tf.argmax() ).\\nIn some rare cases you may want to stop gradients from backpropagating through\\nsome part of your neural network. To do this, you must use the tf.stop_gradient()\\nfunction: it just returns its inputs during the forward pass (like tf.identity() ), but\\nit does not let gradients through during backpropagation (it acts like a constant).

The reason TensorFlow has to analyze the source\\ncode is that Python does not provide any other way to capture control flow state‐\\nments: it offers magic methods like __add__()  or __mul__()  to capture operators like\\n398 | Chapter 12: Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow'),\n",

This\\ncall will build the appropriate tf.while_loop()  operation in the computation graph.\\nFigure 12-4. How TensorFlow generates graphs using autograph and tracing\\nNext, TensorFlow calls this “upgraded” function, but instead of passing the actual\\nargument, it passes a symbolic tensor , meaning a tensor without any actual value, only\\na name, a data type, and a shape. For example, if you call sum_squares(tf.con\\nstant(10)) , then the tf__sum_squares()  function will actually be called with a sym‐\\nbolic tensor of type int32 and shape []. The function will run in graph mode , meaning\\nthat each TensorFlow operation will just add a node in the graph to represent itself\\nand its output tensor(s) (as opposed to the regular mode, called eager execution , or\\neager mode ). In graph mode, TF operations do not perform any actual computations.\\nThis should feel familiar if you know TensorFlow 1, as graph mode was the default\\nmode. In Figure 12-4 , you can see the tf__sum_squares()  function being called with\\na symbolic tensor as argument (in this case, an int32 tensor of shape []), and the final\\ngraph generated during tracing.

If you replace np.random.rand()  with tf.random.uniform([]) , then a\\nnew random number will be generated upon every call, since the operation\\nwill be part of the graph.\\n—If your non-TensorFlow code has side-effects (such as logging something or\\nupdating a Python counter), then you should not expect that side-effect to\\noccur every time you call the TF Function, as it will only occur when the func‐\\ntion is traced.\\n—Y ou can wrap arbitrary Python code in a tf.py_function()  operation, but\\nthis will hinder performance, as TensorFlow will not be able to do any graph\\noptimization on this code, and it will also reduce portability, as the graph will\\nonly run on platforms where Python is available (and the right libraries\\ninstalled).\\n•Y ou can call other Python functions or TF Functions, but they should follow the\\nsame rules, as TensorFlow will also capture their operations in the computation\\ngraph. Note that these other functions do not need to be decorated with\\n@tf.function .\\n•If the function creates a TensorFlow variable (or any other stateful TensorFlow\\nobject, such as a dataset or a queue), it must do so upon the very first call, and\\nonly then, or else you will get an exception.

Protocol Buffers are defined using a simple language that looks like\\nthis:\\nsyntax = \"proto3\" ;\\nmessage Person {\\n  string name = 1;\\n  int32 id = 2;\\n  repeated  string email = 3;\\n}\\nThis definition says we are using the protobuf format version 3, and it specifies that\\neach Person  object6 may (optionally) have a name  of type string , an id of type int32 ,\\nand zero or more email  fields, each of type string . The numbers 1, 2 and 3 are the\\nfield identifiers: they will be used in each record’s binary representation. Once you\\nhave a definition in a .proto  file, you can compile it. This requires protoc , the proto‐\\nbuf compiler, to generate access classes in Python (or some other language). Note that\\nthe protobuf definitions we will use have already been compiled for you, and their\\nPython classes are part of TensorFlow, so you will not need to use protoc .

Here is a simple numeri‐\\ncal column named \"housing_median_age\" :\\nhousing_median_age  = tf.feature_column .numeric_column (\"housing_median_age\" )\\nNumeric columns let you specify a normalization function using the normalizer_fn\\nargument. For example, let’s tweak the \"housing_median_age\"  column to define how\\nit should be scaled.

For example,\\nlet’s create a bucketized column based on the median_income  column, with 5 buckets:\\nless than 1.5 ($15,000), then 1.5 to 3, 3 to 4.5, 4.5 to 6., and above 6.

The idea of\\nusing vectors to represent words dates back to the 1960s, and many sophisticated\\ntechniques have been used to generate useful vectors, including using neural net‐\\nworks, but things really took off in 2013, when Tomáš Mikolov and other Google\\nresearchers published a paper10 describing how to learn word embeddings using deep\\nneural networks, much faster than previous attempts. This allowed them to learn\\nembeddings on a very large corpus of text: they trained a deep neural network to pre‐\\ndict the words near any given word. This allowed them to obtain astounding word\\nembeddings. For example, synonyms had very close embeddings, and semantically\\nrelated words such as France, Spain, Italy, and so on, ended up clustered together.

Why are these tasks so effortless to us humans? The answer lies in the\\nfact that perception largely takes place outside the realm of our consciousness, within\\nspecialized visual, auditory, and other sensory modules in our brains. By the time\\nsensory information reaches our consciousness, it is already adorned with high-level\\nfeatures; for example, when you look at a picture of a cute puppy, you cannot choose\\nnot to see the puppy, or not to notice its cuteness. Nor can you explain how you rec‐\\nognize a cute puppy; it’s just obvious to you.

In particular, they showed that many neurons in\\nthe visual cortex have a small local receptive field, meaning they react only to visual\\nstimuli located in a limited region of the visual field (see Figure 14-1 , in which the\\nlocal receptive fields of five neurons are represented by dashed circles). The receptive\\nfields of different neurons may overlap, and together they tile the whole visual field.\\nMoreover, the authors showed that some neurons react only to images of horizontal\\nlines, while others react only to lines with different orientations (two neurons may\\nhave the same receptive field but react to different line orientations). They also\\nnoticed that some neurons have larger receptive fields, and they react to more com‐\\nplex patterns that are combinations of the lower-level patterns. These observations\\nled to the idea that the higher-level neurons are based on the outputs of neighboring\\nlower-level neurons (in Figure 14-1 , notice that each neuron is connected only to a\\nfew neurons from the previous layer).

If a training batch contains 100 instances, then this layer will use up 1.2 GB\\nof RAM!\\nDuring inference (i.e., when making a prediction for a new instance) the RAM occu‐\\npied by one layer can be released as soon as the next layer has been computed, so you\\nonly need as much RAM as required by two consecutive layers. But during training\\neverything computed during the forward pass needs to be preserved for the reverse\\npass, so the amount of RAM needed is (at least) the total amount of RAM required by\\nall layers.\\nIf training crashes because of an out-of-memory error, you can try\\nreducing the mini-batch size. Alternatively, you can try reducing\\ndimensionality using a stride, or removing a few layers. Or you can\\ntry using 16-bit floats instead of 32-bit floats. Or you could distrib‐\\nute the CNN across multiple devices.\\nNow let’s look at the second common building block of CNNs: the pooling layer .\\nPooling Layer\\nOnce you understand how convolutional layers work, the pooling layers are quite\\neasy to grasp. Their goal is to subsample  (i.e., shrink) the input image in order to\\nreduce the computational load, the memory usage, and the number of parameters\\n(thereby limiting the risk of overfitting).\\nJust like in convolutional layers, each neuron in a pooling layer is connected to the\\noutputs of a limited number of neurons in the previous layer, located within a small\\nrectangular receptive field. Y ou must define its size, the stride, and the padding type,\\njust like before. However, a pooling neuron has no weights; all it does is aggregate the\\ninputs using an aggregation function such as the max or mean. Figure 14-8  shows a\\nmax pooling layer , which is the most common type of pooling layer. In this example,\\n442 | Chapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks'),\n",

By inserting a max pooling layer every few layers in\\na CNN, it is possible to get some level of translation invariance at a larger scale.\\nMoreover, max pooling also offers a small amount of rotational invariance and a\\nslight scale invariance.

It confirmed the general\\ntrend: models are getting deeper and deeper, with fewer and fewer parameters. The\\nkey to being able to train such a deep network is to use skip connections  (also called\\nshortcut connections ): the signal feeding into a layer is also added to the output of a\\nlayer located a bit higher up the stack. Let’s see why this is useful.\\nWhen training a neural network, the goal is to make it model a target function h(x).\\nIf you add the input x to the output of the network (i.e., you add a skip connection),\\nthen the network will be forced to model f(x) = h(x) – x rather than h(x). This is\\ncalled residual learning  (see Figure 14-15 ).\\nFigure 14-15. Residual learning\\nWhen you initialize a regular neural network, its weights are close to zero, so the net‐\\nwork just outputs values close to zero. If you add a skip connection, the resulting net‐\\nwork just outputs a copy of its inputs; in other words, it initially models the identity\\nfunction. If the target function is fairly close to the identity function (which is often\\nthe case), this will speed up training considerably.\\nMoreover, if you add many skip connections, the network can start making progress\\neven if several layers have not started learning yet (see Figure 14-16 ). Thanks to skip\\nconnections, the signal can easily make its way across the whole network.

While a regular convolutional layer\\nuses filters that try to simultaneously capture spatial patterns (e.g., an oval) and cross-\\nchannel patterns (e.g., mouth + nose + eyes = face), a separable convolutional layer\\nmakes the strong assumption that spatial patterns and cross-channel patterns can be\\nmodeled separately (see Figure 14-19 ).

This bot‐\\ntleneck step forces the SE Block to learn a general representation of the feature com‐\\nbinations (we will see this principle in action again when we discuss autoencoders\\nin ???).

It’s a good\\nidea to spend time looking for the right tools. To annotate images with bounding\\nboxes, you may want to use an open source image labeling tool like VGG Image\\nAnnotator, LabelImg, OpenLabeler or ImgLab, or perhaps a commercial tool like\\nLabelBox or Supervisely. Y ou may also want to consider crowdsourcing platforms\\nsuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower if you have a very large number of\\nimages to annotate. However, it is quite a lot of work to setup a crowdsourcing plat‐\\nform, prepare the form to be sent to the workers, to supervise them and ensure the\\nquality of the bounding boxes they produce is good, so make sure it is worth the\\neffort: if there are just a few thousand images to label, and you don’t plan to do this\\nfrequently, it may be preferable to do it yourself. Adriana Kovashka et al. wrote a very\\npractical paper22 about crowdsourcing in Computer Vision, I recommend you check\\nit out, even if you do not plan to use crowdsourcing.\\nSo let’s suppose you obtained the bounding boxes for every image in the flowers data‐\\nset (for now we will assume there is a single bounding box per image), you then need\\nto create a dataset whose items will be batches of preprocessed images along with\\ntheir class labels and their bounding boxes. Each item should be a tuple of the form:\\n(images, (class_labels, bounding_boxes)) .

Also, it is common to predict the square root of the\\nheight and width rather than the height and width directly: this\\nway, a 10 pixel error for a large bounding box will not be penalized\\nas much as a 10 pixel error for a small bounding box.\\nThe MSE often works fairly well as a cost function to train the model, but it is not a\\ngreat metric to evaluate how well the model can predict bounding boxes.

Fortunately, there is a much faster way to\\nslide a CNN across an image: using a Fully Convolutional Network .\\nFully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)\\nThe idea of FCNs was first introduced in a 2015 paper23 by Jonathan Long et al., for\\nsemantic segmentation (the task of classifying every pixel in an image according to\\nthe class of the object it belongs to). They pointed out that you could replace the\\ndense layers at the top of a CNN by convolutional layers. To understand this, let’s look\\nat an example: suppose a dense layer with 200 neurons sits on top of a convolutional\\nlayer that outputs 100 feature maps, each of size 7 × 7 (this is the feature map size, not\\nthe kernel size). Each neuron will compute a weighted sum of all 100 × 7 × 7 activa‐\\ntions from the convolutional layer (plus a bias term). Now let’s see what happens if we\\nreplace the dense layer with a convolution layer using 200 filters, each 7 × 7, and with\\nV ALID padding. This layer will output 200 feature maps, each 1 × 1 (since the kernel\\nis exactly the size of the input feature maps and we are using V ALID padding). In\\nother words, it will output 200 numbers, just like the dense layer did, and if you look\\nclosely at the computations performed by a convolutional layer, you will notice that\\nthese numbers will be precisely the same as the dense layer produced. The only differ‐\\nence is that the dense layer’s output was a tensor of shape [batch size, 200] while the\\nconvolutional layer will output a tensor of shape [batch size, 1, 1, 200].\\nTo convert a dense layer to a convolutional layer, the number of fil‐\\nters in the convolutional layer must be equal to the number of units\\nin the dense layer, the filter size must be equal to the size of the\\ninput feature maps, and you must use V ALID padding. The stride\\nmay be set to 1 or more, as we will see shortly.\\nWhy is this important? Well, while a dense layer expects a specific input size (since it\\nhas one weight per input feature), a convolutional layer will happily process images of\\nany size24 (however, it does expect its inputs to have a specific number of channels,\\nsince each kernel contains a different set of weights for each input channel). Since an\\nFCN contains only convolutional layers (and pooling layers, which have the same\\nproperty), it can be trained and executed on images of any size!\\nObject Detection | 473'),\n",

Moreover, 448 can be neatly divided by 2 several times until we reach 7, without any round‐\\ning error. If any layer uses a different stride than 1 or 2, then there may be some rounding error, so again the\\nfeature maps may end up being smaller.For example, suppose we already trained a CNN for flower classification and localiza‐\\ntion. It was trained on 224 × 224 images and it outputs 10 numbers: outputs 0 to 4 are\\nsent through the softmax activation function, and this gives the class probabilities\\n(one per class); output 5 is sent through the logistic activation function, and this gives\\nthe objectness score; outputs 6 to 9 do not use any activation function, and they rep‐\\nresent the bounding box’s center coordinates, and its height and width. We can now\\nconvert its dense layers to convolutional layers. In fact, we don’t even need to retrain\\nit, we can just copy the weights from the dense layers to the convolutional layers!\\nAlternatively, we could have converted the CNN into an FCN before training.\\nNow suppose the last convolutional layer before the output layer (also called the bot‐\\ntleneck layer) outputs 7 × 7 feature maps when the network is fed a 224 × 224 image\\n(see the left side of Figure 14-25 ). If we feed the FCN a 448 × 448 image (see the right\\nside of Figure 14-25 ), the bottleneck layer will now output 14 × 14 feature maps.25\\nSince the dense output layer was replaced by a convolutional layer using 10 filters of\\nsize 7 × 7, V ALID padding and stride 1, the output will be composed of 10 features\\nmaps, each of size 8 × 8 (since 14 - 7 + 1 = 8). In other words, the FCN will process\\nthe whole image only once and it will output an 8 × 8 grid where each cell contains 10\\nnumbers (5 class probabilities, 1 objectness score and 4 bounding box coordinates).\\nIt’s exactly like taking the original CNN and sliding it across the image using 8 steps\\nper row and 8 steps per column: to visualize this, imagine chopping the original\\nimage into a 14 × 14 grid, then sliding a 7 × 7 window across this grid: there will be 8\\n× 8 = 64 possible locations for the window, hence 8 × 8 predictions.

That’s a total of 45 numbers per grid cell (5 * 4 bounding box coordi‐\\nnates, plus 5 objectness scores, plus 20 class probabilities).\\n•Second, instead of predicting the absolute coordinates of the bounding box cen‐\\nters, YOLOv3 predicts an offset relative to the coordinates of the grid cell, where\\n(0, 0) means the top left of that cell, and (1, 1) means the bottom right. For each\\ngrid cell, YOLOv3 is trained to predict only bounding boxes whose center lies in\\nthat cell (but the bounding box itself generally extends well beyond the grid cell).\\nYOLOv3 applies the logistic activation function to the bounding box coordinates\\nto ensure they remain in the 0 to 1 range.\\n•Third, before training the neural net, YOLOv3 finds 5 representative bounding\\nbox dimensions, called anchor boxes  (or bounding box priors ): it does this by\\napplying the K-Means algorithm (see ???) to the height and width of the training\\nset bounding boxes. For example, if the training images contain many pedes‐\\ntrians, then one of the anchor boxes will likely have the dimensions of a typical\\npedestrian. Then when the neural net predicts 5 bounding boxes per grid cell, it\\nactually predicts how much to rescale each of the anchor boxes. For example,\\nsuppose one anchor box is 100 pixels tall and 50 pixels wide, and the network\\npredicts, say, a vertical rescaling factor of 1.5 and a horizontal rescaling of 0.9 (for\\none of the grid cells), this will result in a predicted bounding box of size 150 × 45\\npixels. To be more precise, for each grid cell and each anchor box, the network\\npredicts the log of the vertical and horizontal rescaling factors. Having these pri‐\\nors makes the network more likely to predict bounding boxes of the appropriate\\ndimensions, and it also speeds up training since it will more quickly learn what\\nreasonable bounding boxes look like.\\n•Fourth, the network is trained using images of different scales: every few batches\\nduring training, the network randomly chooses a new image dimension (from\\n330 × 330 to 608 × 608 pixels).

To understand this met‐\\nric, let’s go back to two classification metrics we discussed in Chapter 3 : precision and\\nrecall. Remember the tradeoff: the higher the recall, the lower the precision. Y ou can\\nvisualize this in a Precision/Recall curve (see Figure 3-5 ). To summarize this curve\\ninto a single number, we could compute its Area Under the Curve (AUC). But note\\nthat the Precision/Recall curve may contain a few sections where precision actually\\ngoes up when recall increases, especially at low recall values (you can see this at the\\ntop left of Figure 3-5 ). This is one of the motivations for the mAP metric.\\nSuppose the classifier has a 90% precision at 10% recall, but a 96% precision at 20%\\nrecall: there’s really no tradeoff here: it simply makes more sense to use the classifier\\nat 20% recall rather than at 10% recall, as you will get both higher recall and higher\\nprecision. So instead of looking at the precision at 10% recall, we should really be\\nlooking at the maximum  precision that the classifier can offer with at least  10% recall.\\nIt would be 96%, not 90%. So one way to get a fair idea of the model’s performance is\\nto compute the maximum precision you can get with at least 0% recall, then 10%\\nrecall, 20%, and so on up to 100%, and then calculate the mean of these maximum\\nprecisions. This is called the Average Precision  (AP) metric. Now when there are more\\nthan 2 classes, we can compute the AP for each class, and then compute the mean AP\\n(mAP). That’s it!\\nHowever, in an object detection systems, there is an additional level of complexity:\\nwhat if the system detected the correct class, but at the wrong location (i.e., the\\nbounding box is completely off)? Surely we should not count this as a positive predic‐\\ntion. So one approach is to define an IOU threshold: for example, we may consider\\nthat a prediction is correct only if the IOU is greater than, say, 0.5, and the predicted\\nclass is correct. The corresponding mAP is generally noted mAP@0.5 (or mAP@50%,\\nor sometimes just AP50). In some competitions (such as the Pascal VOC challenge),\\nthis is what is done. In others (such as the COCO competition), the mAP is computed\\nfor different IOU thresholds (0.50, 0.55, 0.60, …, 0.95), and the final metric is the\\nmean of all these mAPs (noted AP@[.50:.95] or AP@[.50:0.05:.95]).

Note\\nthat different objects of the same class are not distinguished. For example, all the bicy‐\\ncles on the right side of the segmented image end up as one big lump of pixels. The\\nmain difficulty in this task is that when images go through a regular CNN, they grad‐\\nually lose their spatial resolution (due to the layers with strides greater than 1): so a\\nregular CNN may end up knowing that there’s a person in the image, somewhere in\\nthe bottom left of the image, but it will not be much more precise than that.\\n478 | Chapter 14: Deep Computer Vision Using Convolutional Neural Networks'),\n",

A former Googler, he led the Y ou‐\\nTube video classification team from 2013 to 2016. He was also a founder and CTO of\\nWifirst from 2002 to 2012, a leading Wireless ISP in France; and a founder and CTO\\nof Polyconseil in 2001, the firm that now manages the electric car sharing service\\nAutolib’ .\\nBefore this he worked as an engineer in a variety of domains: finance (JP Morgan and\\nSociété Générale), defense (Canada’s DOD), and healthcare (blood transfusion). He\\npublished a few technical books (on C++, WiFi, and internet architectures), and was\\na Computer Science lecturer in a French engineering school.\\nA few fun facts: he taught his three children to count in binary with their fingers (up\\nto 1023), he studied microbiology and evolutionary genetics before going into soft‐\\nware engineering, and his parachute didn’t open on the second jump.\\nColophon\\nThe animal on the cover of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Ten‐\\nsorFlow  is the fire salamander ( Salamandra salamandra ), an amphibian found across\\nmost of Europe. Its black, glossy skin features large yellow spots on the head and\\nback, signaling the presence of alkaloid toxins. This is a possible source of this\\namphibian’s common name: contact with these toxins (which they can also spray\\nshort distances) causes convulsions and hyperventilation. Either the painful poisons\\nor the moistness of the salamander’s skin (or both) led to a misguided belief that these\\ncreatures not only could survive being placed in fire but could extinguish it as well.\\nFire salamanders live in shaded forests, hiding in moist crevices and under logs near\\nthe pools or other freshwater bodies that facilitate their breeding. Though they spend\\nmost of their life on land, they give birth to their young in water. They subsist mostly\\non a diet of insects, spiders, slugs, and worms. Fire salamanders can grow up to a foot\\nin length, and in captivity, may live as long as 50 years.\\nThe fire salamander’s numbers have been reduced by destruction of their forest habi‐\\ntat and capture for the pet trade, but the greatest threat is the susceptibility of their\\nmoisture-permeable skin to pollutants and microbes. Since 2014, they have become\\nextinct in parts of the Netherlands and Belgium due to an introduced fungus.\\nMany of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to\\nthe world.

They provide the necessary tools and expertise to tackle the challenges associated with the project, ensuring that we deliver a robust and high-quality solution.\\n\\n Project Background\\n\\nThe inspiration for this project stems from a pressing need within the field of musculoskeletal health. Patients undergoing physiotherapy often face the challenge of maintaining proper posture, which is essential for their recovery and overall well-being. This need is particularly pronounced in cases where physiotherapists cannot be present at all times to provide real-time guidance and supervision. \\n\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, engaging a personal trainer or assistant for regular posture correction exercises can be both expensive and time-consuming. Many individuals with musculoskeletal issues find it difficult to access expert guidance consistently, limiting the effectiveness of their exercises. \\n\\n\\n\\nRecognizing these challenges, our project was conceived to bridge this gap in patient care by developing a web application .We aim to provide an accessible and cost-effective solution. This application serves as a virtual assistant, offering continuous guidance and feedback to users, thereby helping them to rectify their posture issues and improve their musculoskeletal health, all while mitigating the difficulties and time constraints often associated with these endeavors.\\n\\n Literature Review\\n\\n\\n\\n1.4.1 Research:\\n\\nResearch on \"Posture and Musculoskeletal Implications for Students Using Mobile Phones\" is highly relevant in the context of the current trend of remote learning. This research can shed light on the impact of extended mobile phone use on posture and musculoskeletal health, which aligns with the concerns our project aims to address.\\n\\n1.4.2 Products: \\n\\n1. \"Wearable Posture Correction Devices\" such as the Upright GO 2 Premium are examples of products that are gaining popularity. These devices provide real-time feedback and reminders to users, helping them maintain proper posture. Mentioning specific products like this demonstrates the practical applications of posture correction technology [5].\\n\\n2. \"User-centric Applications\" that focus on customization and personalized exercise plans are in line with the user-centered approach we aim to adopt in our project. This trend emphasizes the importance of engaging users actively in their posture correction efforts [6].\\n\\n3. The idea of \"Building a Poor Body Posture Detection & Alert System\" aligns with the core objective of our project, which is to develop a real-time posture monitoring and correction system. This could serve as a relevant research direction and product concept for your literature review [3].\\n\\n1.5. Analysis from Literature Review \\n\\nAfter reading the above literature reviews and viewing the products come to conclusion that there is need for a solutions that is friendly and have real updates. Many products and services like Phio need subscription and difficult to get access. We have to get program code. Apps like Total Rehab only provides clinical video demo and required subscription.[2]\\n\\n1.6.

using Linux and that's just like really sad because it's a superior free open source operating system but only has a 4% share of the PC market luckily though 96% of the non-human Bots watching this video are using Linux because it is the dominant OS on the server if you're a programmer or developer you need to know Linux that's where your code will eventually run and fail and if you can't SSH into a Linux terminal and fix it you are screwed in today's video you'll learn everything you need to know about Linux by looking at 101 essential Concepts over the next 10 minutes if you survive until the end you should magically grow neck beard and be able to technobabble like an arch user before one can understand Linux though one must recognize what came before it Unix an operating system developed at AT&T Bell labs in the 70s its development led to a standardization called posix or portable operating system interface to ensure that different systems would be compatible with each other its influence remains strong today with Ma ma OS Android FreeBSD and most Linux dros being posix compliant in 1987 an OS called Minix for academic use was developed but redistribution of its code was restricted this inspired a Finnish computer science student named lonus torald to develop Linux in 1991 importantly it's free open- source software licens under GPL 2.0 and by free I mean free is in Freedom it's free to distribute modify and make money off of now what I'm referring to as Linux is in fact not an operating system but rather an operating system kernel it's written in the C programming language and is the black magic that sits between your software applications and the hardware when you hit the power button on your computer the boot loader which is usually grub will load the Linux kernel into random access memory from there it detects hardware and starts the init system which is typically a tool called system D although Alternatives do exist once initialized the kernel will start up applications in user space which will typically bring the user to a login screen as the user starts doing stuff the kernel has a lot of respons ibility it allocates and deallocates memory for processes and can even create virtual memory to use more memory than is physically available by tapping into your hard drive speaking of the hard drive the kernel also provides a virtual file system to interact with files on different systems the fourth extended file system is the most common default on Linux but it's not the only option the kernel also interacts with all these peripheral devices via drivers pretty cool but you can't just walk up and mess around with the kernel and that's because it's surrounded by the cpu's protection ring at ring zero we have the kernel with the highest level of privilege While most of us normies in user space live in ring three with the lowest level of privilege but often you'll want to do something that requires access to the kernel like write a file to the file system and that's where system calls come in in the C code here you'll notice that I'm making a CIS call to write which will transition from ring three to ring zero to Output some text to the console however right itself is not a system call it's actually a rapper provided by GBC which is the G new standard library for C and provides all kinds of rappers for making system calls that can do almost anything on your OS but wait a minute what is gnu it's pronounced gnu and it's a project that predates the Linux kernel itself and was started all the way back in 1983 by Richard stalman it provides all the core utilities for Linux which are all the software utilities that make the kernel useful to humans the best way to start exploring these core Libs is to open up the terminal which is a graphical user interface that allows you to send commands via the shell now they call this thing a shell because it provides a layer of protection between user space and the kernel there are many different flavors of shells but the most common is Bash let's say hello to the Linux kernel by running the ganu shell utility Echo and providing a string argument to it this command takes our message and prints it to the standard output pretty simple but what actually happened under the hood is that a system call was made to the kernel which checked permissions and manage drivers to turn those ones and zeros into pixels on the screen as an end user though I don't care my friend told me about a cool command called touch but I have no idea what it does the cool thing about Linux is that you can pull up the manual for any command by hitting up my main man man it looks like this command is used to create a new file man Isn't that cool let's go ahead and try it out now by creating a new text file it looks like nothing happened but I promise it worked I can prove it by using the ls command to list out the files in this directory and there it is and we can read the file contents with the cat command but again nothing happens because there's no data in this file however there is a bunch bunch of metadata like timestamps that we can access with the stat command is stat rhymes with cat and when we run it we know this file's birth time when it was modified and when it was last accessed that's useful but we can also get more information from the ls command by appending Flags to it like the L flag to list more details and the H flag to make them human readable when we run that command we can now see the exact size of every file and we can also combine flags and Linux to make this command more concise I don't want an empty file though so I'm just going to remove it with the RM command the cool thing about the Linux terminal is that it's really easy to combine commands like I can take Echo and use this angle bracket to redirect its output to a new file in addition I can flip this angle bracket around to also redirect the input of a file that's cool but pipes are even cooler they allow you to take the output of one command and pass it off to another command like for example if we have a log file of our broken code we might first use cat to read that file but then we could pipe the output to sort which would sort it line by line and then unique to remove any duplicates there's so much more we could do just from the terminal but if you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again it might be time to write a bash script in its own dedicated file but to create that file we'll use an interactive text editor if you have a few years to spare you could try learning Vim or if you have no life at all you could try emac but I'm going to create this file with Nano a minimal text editor built into most Linux dros at the top of the file We'll add a shebang that tells Linux to use the bash interpreter then we can add as much bash code as we want here like we might use Echo and then read to read a value from the standard input and then Echo to once again Echo it back and now if we save this file we can execute it by simply entering the file path in the terminal and that brings us to the halfway mark unfortunately 100 topics is not nearly enough to cover the entire Linux ecosystem if your goal is to become an apex Alpha Linux gigachad and check out my brand new full Linux course for fireship pro members the course contains over 30 videos of Hands-On Linux topics along with quizzes for regular dopamine hits that will help you master the fundamentals of Linux quickly but most importantly it will teach you how to spin up your own virtual private server to self-host your own applications but one major drawback of using Linux is that it might trigger an existential crisis and you might ask yourself who am I when you enter that command it's going to return your Linux username in addition every user has a unique uid that can be viewed with the ID command my ID is 1000 but there is one special user with a uid of zero called root AKA admin super user or daddy root has the highest level of privilege and you can switch to the root user with the Su command or prefix any command with pseudo to run it with elevated privilege any user can be granted pseudo privilege and you can check your privilege right now by running pseudo flag l in addition to users Linux also has groups groups have group IDs and make it easier to manage permissions for multiple users before we talk about permissions though let's explore the file system by default we're in our home directory which is like a personal workspace for the user you're logged in as we might make a new directory here using the make dur command then use CD to change directories into it now run PWD to print the current working directory but now let's venture outside of our home into the root of the file system by running cd/ if you hit LS here you'll find a bunch of critical directories that you need to know aot like boot contains the Linux kernel itself Dev contains external devices like hard drives Etc contains config files and VAR contains log files the most interesting directory here though is bin which holds your binaries and spin for system binaries you see when you run a command like LS Linux looks for an executable binary on your system to execute the thing is binaries not only live here but also under the user system Resources directory and potentially anywhere you want on the file system and that begs the question how does Linux know where to find the right binary well that's where path comes in it's a special environment variable that contains paths to directories separated by colons when you enter a command Linux will search through the path for a matching binary in each directory and execute the first one it finds its value is set on the system by default but it's common to customize it by using the export keyword which will set the value for an environment variable the most common technique is to update the path for an individual user by customizing The Bash RC file which itself is a script that will run before every terminal session and now that we're inside this file we can also do things like customize the PS1 environment variable to change the terminal prompt to look more like a mega hardcore hacker when coding at Starbucks which is a proven way to attract a mate as a Linux user but now it's time to talk about file permissions use LS flag L on any file to view permissions and notice these cryptic nine characters these are called symbolic permissions the first triplet represents the owner the middle the group and the last triplet is for everyone else each one contains a letter that represents read write and execute privileges if the letter is present it means access granted but if there's a dash it means permission denied these can also be represented as numbers in o notation for example 777 lets anybody do anything to a file I know Triple 7 is good on slot machines but in Linux it's generally a bad idea because you want to always follow the principle of lease privilege Grant access to things only when necessary and trust no one now you can modify the permissions on a file with the chamod command like here I'm using it to Grant read access to a document for everybody we can also change the owner of a file with Chon or assign groups with ch group and now that we know what all these things mean permissions aren't so cryp now anytime you run a command or execute a program it creates a process on the CPU which is managed by the Linux kernel you can view these processes with a command and notice how each one has a unique process ID along with the user who created it or better yet use htop to get an interactive breakdown of processes that can be filtered some of these are just system demons that run in the background we all have our demons in fact if you have a long running script you can even create your own background process by adding an Amper sand to the end of it or if you want a a script run on a specific schedule like a reminder to do something at 4:20 p.m. today you can accomplish that by adding your script to the cron tab that's cool but occasionally you'll have a bad process that needs to be killed the kill command can do that by gracefully sending a Sig term signal to the process if that doesn't do the trick though use the nine flag to forcefully kill it with Sig kill we've barely scratched the surface but so far everything we've looked at is pretty standard on most Linux machines other utilities you should know about include GP for searching through text said for modifying tax gzip for making files smaller and tar for archiving directories but the Linux experience varies wildly when talking about different dros a Linux distribution is just a complete operating system built on the Linux kernel and each drro has a highly opinionated set of default software for their target audience some are designed for beginners others for hardcore hackers and everything in between dros can have different package managers to install new software like a yum and Pac-Man and they might also have different release schedules like some have a predictable fixed release date While others have ruling releases that keep their software on The Cutting Edge at all times and one thing we didn't even talk about is desktop environments if using Linux as a PC your Dro will have a default desktop environment like gnome or KD plasma and that makes a huge difference in the experience some distro families you should know about include slackware the Original Gangster from the 9s Debian the most popular Dro overall famous for its open philosophy and ease of use red hat the dro of choice and Enterprise for its long-term support plans and finally the arch family if someday you find yourself saying I use Arch by the way unironically it means you've embrace the Paradox of complexity and simplicity and your operating system is no longer just a tool but a reflection of your own dominance and Mastery over the digital world thanks for watching check out the full course if you want to go
