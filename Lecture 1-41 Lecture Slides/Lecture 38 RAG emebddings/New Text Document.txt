embedding [ numerical represenatation - vector form]
after splttinng the document into chunks the next step is embedding . so for this purpose we use embedding models. 
Actually they take input and convert them into the numerical representation so we can perfrom mathematical operations which will be helpful in retrieving our document . So semantic serach also become possible . in semantic search the words whose meanings are closer their numerical represeantion is also closer. 
wehere this emebddings can be be useful 
1.similarity search ( to measure similarity between different instance especiallt NLP tasks)
2.clustering and classification ( where we can use emebeding as input features)
3.information retreieval (we can utilizize theses emedidngs to build search engine)
4.Recommendation systems ( by taking advantage of these recommend prouduct,articles or media to user)



for this purpseose EMbeddings class is sued. there are several provider like openai. Some are open-source while other need payment . we can pass them either document  (multiple text ) or quer-(single text).
Some of the emending models are 
A121 Labs 
Azure OpenAI
GigaChat
Google Generarative AI Emebeddigs
