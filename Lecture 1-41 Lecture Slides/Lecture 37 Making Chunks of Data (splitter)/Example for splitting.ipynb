Project Backgro und \\nThe inspiration for this project stems from a pressing need within the field of musculoskeletal \\nhealth. Patients undergoing physiotherapy often face the challenge of maintaining proper \\nposture, which is essential for their recovery and overall well -being. This need is particularly \\npronounced in cases where physiotherapists cannot be present at all times to provide real -time \\nguidance and supervision.  \\n \\nFurthermore, engaging a personal trainer or assistant for regular posture correction exercises \\ncan be b oth expensive and time -consuming. Many individuals with musculoskeletal issues find \\nit difficult to access expert guidance consistently, limiting the effectiveness of their exercises.  \\n \\nRecognizing these challenges, our project was conceived to bridge this  gap in patient care by \\ndeveloping a web application .We aim to provide an accessible and cost -effective solution. \\nThis application serves as a virtual assistant, offering continuous guidance and feedback to '),\n",

Literature Review  \\n \\n1.4.1 Research:  \\nResearch on \"Posture and Musculoskeletal Implications for Students Using Mobile Phones\" is \\nhighly relevant in the context of the current trend of remote learning. This research can shed \\nlight on the impact of extended mobile phone use on posture and musculoskeletal health, which \\naligns with the concerns our project aims t o address.  \\n1.4.2 Products:   \\n1. \"Wearable Posture Correction Devices\" such as the Upright GO 2 Premium are examples of \\nproducts that are gaining popularity. These devices provide real -time feedback and reminders \\nto users, helping them maintain proper postur e. Mentioning specific products like this \\ndemonstrates the practical applications of posture correction technology.  \\n2. \"User -centric Applications\" that focus on customization and personalized exercise plans are \\nin line with the user -centered approach we ai m to adopt in our project. This trend emphasizes \\nthe importance of engaging users actively in their posture correction efforts.  \\n3. The idea of \"Building a Poor Body Posture Detection & Alert System\" aligns with the core \\nobjective of our project, which is t o develop a real -time posture monitoring and correction \\nsystem. This could serve as a relevant research direction and product concept for your literature \\nreview.  \\n1.5. Analysis from Literature Review  \\nAfter reading the above literature reviews and viewing t he products come to conclusion that \\nthere is need for a solutions that is friendly and have real updates. Many products and services \\nlike Phio need subscription and difficult to get access. We have to get program code. Apps like \\nTotal Rehab only provides c linical video demo and required subscription.  \\n1.6.

Iterative and Incremental Development: We will break the project into small, manageable \\nincrements or sprints. Each sprint will focus on specific features or functionalities.  \\n2. Collaborative Teamwork : Agile encourages close collaboration among team members, \\nincluding developers, designers, and d omain experts. We will work closely with \\nphysiotherapists and potential users to ensure that the application meets their needs effectively.  \\n3. Customer -Centric Approach:  Agile places a strong emphasis on customer feedback. We \\nwill regularly demonstrate the  application to users, gather their feedback, and use it to refine \\nthe features and functionalities, ensuring that the end product is aligned with user expectations.  \\n4. Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile allows us to adapt to changing requirements or insi ghts \\nthroughout the project. As we delve deeper into the development process, we can adjust our \\npriorities and approaches as needed to achieve the best possible outcomes.  \\n5. Continuous Testing and Quality Assurance: Quality is paramount, and Agile integrat es \\ntesting into every phase of development. This ensures that the application remains stable and \\nreliable at all times.  \\n \\nBy adopting the agile methodology, we intend to create a responsive and user -centric posture \\ncorrection web application.

    "### Recursively Splitting Text by Characters\n",
    "The idea behind recursively splitting text by characters is to break down large pieces of text into smaller, manageable chunks based on a specified set of characters (like periods, commas, etc.). This is important because some models might have a maximum token limit, so you want to ensure that each chunk is within those limits.\n",
    "here are the steps \n",
    "1. Import the Required Splitter: LangChain provides a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create an Instance of the Splitter: You can specify the set of characters you want to split by (e.g., periods, commas) and the maximum chunk size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Split the Text: Use the splitter to split the loaded text into chunks."
